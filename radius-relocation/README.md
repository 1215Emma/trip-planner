## Future Implementations

The user paste link from Zillow or PadMapper, etc... and it will grab the home address, price, and pictures and create a "radius" profile for that home and pin it on an interactive map. 

User can also pin their favorite places such as restaurants, gyms, concert venues, and more. You can also create custom pins for things such as your work or a friends house. 

Each pinned home has a radius that is displayed visually to show you how far things are from you so you can compare which home has what you want near it.

Eventually you'll be able to check how long it takes to reach a certain location from the home and add that time/distance to the homes radius profile.
